# hello-world
I'm using this repository to learn more about scientific coding mainly on Python

This is mainly a test file that I'm using to practice working on GitHub.
As someone who has worked on Word his whole life (except for a short stint on Docs in high school)
GitHub is quite terrifying.

So this readme file has been edited on my own laptop after cloning it from my existing repository.

Test 2 for adding new things onto GitHub
